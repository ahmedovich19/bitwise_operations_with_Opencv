# bitwise_operations_with_Opencv
we implemented a Python script to perform the AND, OR, XOR, and NOT bitwise operators with OpenCV.
binary operations:

AND: A bitwise AND is true if and only if both pixels are greater than zero.
OR: A bitwise OR is true if either of the two pixels is greater than zero.
XOR: A bitwise XOR is true if and only if one of the two pixels is greater than zero, but not both.
NOT: A bitwise NOT inverts the “on” and “off” pixels in an image.
